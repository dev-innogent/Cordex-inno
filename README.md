## Prerequisites

Building any of the Java modules requires **Maven** and a recent JDK. On Debian/Ubuntu systems you can install Maven with:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y maven
```

After installation verify it with `mvn -version` before running Maven commands like `mvn test`.
