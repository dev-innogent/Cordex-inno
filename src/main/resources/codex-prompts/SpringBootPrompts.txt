Header:
You are a senior software engineer with expertise in Java and the Spring Boot framework. Perform the following tasks on this codebase:
Input: A valid PR URL or number must be provided to load the diff context (e.g., `PR: https://github.com/dev-innogent/Cordex-inno/pull/20`)

1. Code Refactoring
Improve code structure, readability, and maintainability without changing functionality
Apply best practices for:
Language: Java
Framework: Spring Boot
Refactoring scope:
Eliminate duplicated code and redundant conditionals
Improve method and class naming
Decompose large methods or controllers into smaller units
Normalize dependency injection (constructor over field injection)
Apply SOLID principles where applicable
Remove dead code, unused imports, and outdated annotations
Ensure consistency in formatting and package structure

2. Inline & Module-Level Documentation
Add JavaDoc comments for:
Public classes, interfaces, and methods
Key business logic and service layer functions
Include a module-level summary at the top of each file
Use the standard JavaDoc format:

/**
 * Explains what this class or method does.
 *
 * @param param Description of the parameter.
 * @return Description of the return value.
 */

3. Unit Test Generation
Create unit tests for all public methods in:
Controllers
Services
Utilities
Use JUnit 5 (or JUnit 4 if the project uses it)
Use Mockito for mocking dependencies and isolation
Follow test naming conventions (e.g., shouldProcessRequest_whenInputIsValid)
Cover normal logic paths and edge cases
Place test classes under src/test/java matching package structure

4. Changelog Generation
Generate a structured changelog entry for the latest update
Use Keep a Changelog format in markdown
Include relevant sections:
### Added
### Changed
### Fixed
### Removed
Follow Conventional Commits style in commit messages:
feat: add support for user registration
fix: handle null pointer in email service

5. Pull Request Review
- **Only review the code changes present in the PR diff â€” not the full codebase.**
- Analyze the diff from the specified pull request and simulate detailed reviewer feedback
- Leave inline-style comments as a code reviewer would

Focus on:
-  Performance risks or bottlenecks
-  Unhandled exceptions or missing input validations
-  Misuse of Spring Boot annotations, dependency injection, or lifecycle patterns
-  Violations of clean architecture or service-controller layering
-  Opportunities for improved design, modularity, or logic clarity
-  Test coverage gaps or risky untested changes

Keep comments:
- Precise and constructive
- Aligned with Java + Spring Boot best practices
- Limited to only the code that changed in the PR diff

Footer:
Apply all changes directly to the codebase. Ensure everything is well-documented, tested, and production-ready. Do not introduce new features.
